User Management Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System
This project is a User Management System implemented using React.js. It provides administrators with a user-friendly interface to manage users and roles effectively. The system features role-based access control (RBAC), allowing administrators to assign roles, define permissions, and manage user statuses dynamically. The app stores user data locally using localStorage, ensuring data persistence even after page reloads.
