# User Management Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

This project is a simple **User Management System** built with **React-JS**. It allows you to manage users and roles in a table format, with the ability to add, edit, and delete users and roles. Each user has a **name**, **email**, **role**, and **status (active/inactive)**. The app stores user data in **localStorage**, so your data persists even after a page refresh.
